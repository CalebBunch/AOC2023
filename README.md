# AOC2023
Solutions for Advent of Code 2023 in Scala (only up to day 9)

Unfortunately I became too busy to finish the rest of the problems this year.

If you want to run a solution (Make sure you have the input data in the same directory in a file called input.txt):
```
mkdir AdventOfCode2023
```
```
cd AdventOfCode2023
```
```
git clone https://github.com/CalebBunch/AOC2023
```
```
cd AOC2023/day1
```
```
scala Solve.scala
```
